# aq2server

Is a modern build of Action Quake 2 (2022+) that is available for free on Steam.
It incorproate all the enhancements AQ2-TNG.
They have pre built [docker sevrer](https://github.com/actionquake/distrib/tree/main/server) and a great asset manager downloader/libray for a huge range of old maps.

Getting a platform indipendent modern build of AQ2 running on Win, Mac, Linux and in Docker was side project I had knocking around for a while, but these guys utterly nailed it.
